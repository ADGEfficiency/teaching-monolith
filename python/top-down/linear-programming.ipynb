    "## Why not linear programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Many business problems are not linear - but if yours is, linear programs are a huge advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertanitity on the inputs - see [robust optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robust_optimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Linear programming with PuLP\n",
    "\n",
    "We can do linear programming in Python using [PuLP](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/) - a library that abstracts away the mechanics of solving linear programs.  The mathematics of the optimization is not covered here - if you are interested, the [Simplex Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) is a good place to start.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Objective function** - minimize or maximize\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables** - things you can change - continuous, integer, binary\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints** - equality (==) or inequality (>=, <=)\n",
    "\n",
    "## What do we mean by linear?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you have a vector of two variables\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\textbf{V} = \\begin{bmatrix}v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\\\ \\end{bmatrix}$\n",
    "\n",
    "You cannot do operations that are non-linear\n",

    "- multipying a variable by another variable $v_{1} * v_{2} $ (bilinearity)\n",

    "This means that linear programs are limited in scope \n",

    "## Using linear programs in industry\n",
    "\n",
    "Writing linear programs requires two skills\n",
    "1. identifying the business problem can be modelled as a linear program\n",
    "2. writing the objective, variables and constraints as a program\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is harder\n",
    "\n",
    "You don't need to know how the optimization is done\n",
