    "> I used to mixed integer linear programming in Excel an an energy engineer using [OpenSolver](https://opensolver.org/) (University of Auckland, New Zealand) to optimize the dispatch of combined heat and power.  In my previous job as a data scientist we developed [a linear program to dispatch electric battery storage](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/energy-py-linear).  [Tempus Energy](https://blog.tempusenergy.com/blog/2019/8/20/tempus-price-prediction-quality) use the model to dispatch price arbitrage battery storage & to measure electricity price forecast quality.\n",

    "We can do linear programming in Python using [PuLP](https://pythonhosted.org/PuLP/) - a library that abstracts away the mechanics of solving linear programs.  The mathematics of the optimization is not covered here - if you are interested, the [Simplex Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplex_algorithm) is a good place to start.\n",
