# Python

Why Python?

- fast to write - suitable for research,
- allows quick iteration over ideas,
- can be put into production.
- massive ecosystem, mature language.


## Content

### Top down notebooks

This folder has a collection of notebooks that teach Python from the top down - introducing language features as they are needed in a real example.

They provide the student with a view of an entire Python program, immersing the student in a big picture and explaining concepts & components as they appear, in the context of using them in the program.

Two notebooks introduce two methods for getting data from the internet - API's and web scraping.  Being able to create datasets using these two methods are key skills for any data scientist.

The final notebook introduces a technique that has been invaluable in every job I've had - linear programming.  While it is not commonly taught as part of a data science education, it is very useful in industry.  Many business problems are linear!

It is recommended that the notebooks are taught in the following order:
- [using an API](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/python/using-an-api.ipynb)
- [web scraping](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/python/web-scraping.ipynb)

### Bottom up course

Also contained here is a more traditional bottom up introduction to Python, where concepts & syntax are taught explicitly.
