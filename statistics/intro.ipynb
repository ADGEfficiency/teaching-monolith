    "> Much of basic statistics is not intuitive (or, at least, not taught in an intuitive fashion), and the opportunity for misunderstanding and error is massive. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> A strong course in applied statistics should cover basic hypothesis testing, regression, statistical power calculation, model selection, and a statistical programming language like R. \n",

    "## Law of Large Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_large_numbers)\n",
    "\n",
    "The average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the expected value, and will tend to become closer as more trials are performed\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no principle that a small number of observations will coincide with the expected value or that a streak of one value will immediately be \"balanced\" by the others \n",
    "\n",
    "[The gambler's fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_fallacy) = the mistaken belief that, if something happens more frequently than normal during a given period, it will happen less frequently in the future (or vice versa)\n",

    "Chapter 10 of [Statistics Done Wrong - Alex Reinhart](https://www.statisticsdonewrong.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Surveys of statistically significant results reported in medical and psychological trials suggest that many p values are wrong and some statistically insignificant results are actually significant when computed correctly. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Even the prestigious journal Nature isnâ€™t perfect, with roughly **38% of papers making typos and calculation errors in their p values**. \n",
    ">\n",
    ">Other reviews find examples of misclassified data, erroneous duplication of data, inclusion of the wrong dataset entirely, and other mix-ups, all concealed by papers that did not describe their analysis in enough detail for the errors to be easily noticed. \n",

    "## What to look for in a statistical analysis\n",

    "\n",
    "> Next Wicherts and his colleagues looked for a correlation between these errors and an unwillingness to share data. There was a clear relationship. \n",
    ">\n",
    "> Authors who refused to share their data were more likely to have committed an error in their paper, and their statistical evidence tended to be weaker. \n",
    "> \n",
    "> Because most authors refused to share their data, Wicherts could not dig for deeper statistical errors, and many more may be lurking. "
