Fizzbuzz
Given a list of timestamps in sequential order, return a list of lists grouped by weekly aggregation.
Given a list of characters, a list of prior of probabilities for each character, and a matrix of probabilities for each character combination, return the optimal sequence for the highest probability.
Given a log file with rows featuring a date, a number, and then a string of names, parse the log file and return the count of unique names aggregated by month.
Product
Given there are no metrics being tracked for Google Docs, a product manager comes to you and asks what are the top five metrics you would implement?
In addition, let’s say theres a dip in the engagement metric of Google Docs. What would you investigate?
Let’s say we want to implement a notification system for reminding nurses to discharge patients at a hospital. How would you implement it?
Let’s say at LinkedIn we want to implement a green dot for an “active user” on the new messaging platform. How would you analyze the effectiveness of it for roll out?
SQL
Given a payment transactions table and a customers table, return the customer’s name and the first transaction that the customer made.
Given a payments transactions table, return a frequency distribution of the number of payments each customer made. (I.E. 1 transaction — 100 customers, 2 transactions — 50 customers, etc…)
Given the same payments table, return the cumulative distribution. (At least one transaction, at least two transactions, etc…)
Given a table of — friend1|friend2. Return the number of mutual friends between two friends.
AB Testing
Given AB test funnel statistics such as the sample size, sign up rate, feature 1 usage rate, feature 2 usage rate, analyze which variant won and why.
How would you design an experiment to change a button on a sign up page?
How do you know if you have enough sample size?
How do you run significance tests on more than one variant?
How do you reduce variance and bias in an AB test?
Explain a P-value and confidence interval to a product manager or non-technical person.
Machine Learning
What features would you use to predict the time spent for a restaurant preparing food from the moment an order comes in?
Can you come up with a scenario in which you would rather under-predict versus over-predict?
Analyzing the results of a model, how would you explain the tradeoff between bias and variance?
Explain how a Random Forest model actual works under the hood.
How do you know if you have enough data for your model?
How do you evaluate a model? (F1 score, ROC curve, cross validation, etc…)
Probability
Given uniform distributions X and Y and the mean 0 and standard deviation 1 for both, what’s the probability of 2X > Y?
There are four people in an elevator and four floors in a building. What’s the probability that each person gets off on a different floor?
