## Interview advice

Know how to introduce yourself.  Memorize the first few sentences of your introduction.  One option is to talk about your education and experience:

>  My name is *Adam*.  I have a *Masters in Energy Engineering* from the *University of Manchester*.  I have worked for *4 years* at *ENGIE UK* as an *Energy Engineer*.

Having something memorized means you will always be off to a good start.

Questions to ask

- training budget
- size of team, how long have they been there (to see if team is new / churning)
- data engineering support
- laptops
- cloud
- do you do deep learning


## Email pitch

Intro
- name
- background

Final project
- 20 seconds
- shareable

Interest to learn more
- excited about the problems you are working on
- love to find out more about the data team / what you are working on

## Applying

## [How to Build a Data Science Portfolio](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-data-science-portfolio-5f566517c79c)

I find that the best portfolio projects are less about doing fancy modeling and more about working with interesting data. A lot of people do things with financial information or Twitter data; those can work, but the data isn’t inherently that interesting, so you’re working uphill.

One of his other points in the article is that webscraping is a great way to get interesting data

When in doubt, here are some projects that hurt you more than they help you:
* Survival classification on the Titanic dataset.
* Hand-written digit classification on the MNIST dataset.
* Flower species classification using the iris dataset.

Resume
1. Length: Keep it simple and one page max. This gives you the most impact for a quick skim. Recommends a simple one column resume as it is easy to skim.
2. Objective: Don’t include one. They don’t help you distinguish yourself from other people. They take away space from the more important things (skills, projects, experience etc). Cover letters are extremely optional unless you really personalize it.
3. Coursework: Do list relevant coursework that is applicable for the job description.
4. Skills: Don’t give numerical ratings for your skills. If you want to rate yourself on your skills, use words like proficient or familiar or things like that. You can even exclude assessments altogether.
5. Skills: Do list technical skills that the job description mentions. The order you list your skills in can suggest what you are best at.
6. Projects: Don’t list common projects or homework. They aren’t that helpful in distinguishing you from other applicants. List projects that are novel.
7. Projects: Show results and include links. If you participated in Kaggle competition, put percentile rank as it helps the person reading your resume understand where you are in the competition. In projects sections, there is always room for links to writeups and papers as they let the hiring manager or recruiter dig in deeper (bias to real world messy problems where you learn something new).

Unlike a resume, which is confined by length, a LinkedIn profile allows you to describe your projects and work experience in more depth. Udacity has a guide on making a good LinkedIn profile. An important part of LinkedIn is their search tool and for you to show up, you must have relevant keywords in your profile. Recruiters often search for people on LinkedIn. LinkedIn allows you to see which companies have searched for you and who has viewed your profile.

The skills listed are merely talking points. Your interviewer most likely understands that you aren't currently an expert at every skill they question. They are likely interviewing you until they get to skills you are unfamiliar with. How do you respond when you don't know something? Do you admit it, or do you try and cover your competency? Are you defensive or are you curious? **This is a continuous learning and feedback role.**
