## what is deep learning

from goodfellow lex fridman interviev
goodfellow - DL = ML that defines learning parameters at more than one step

shallow = learning operations that happen in parallel

three parts
- model = data + params -> prediction (ff, conv. recurr)
- optimization = model for updating parameters (grad descent, evolution)
- dataset - repersontation of the world

logistic regression = noisy data, or when need quick inference
