- bathroom - shut the main door
- dishwasher - use it!  don't put your dishes in the sink!

Course management
- weekend classes
- one or two classes will change (sickness etc) - we just don't know which one!
- Slack & Google Calendar
- [feedback form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdKHpElzYPwoiGsECPC62ALh_RzADgHv8qO8tMR6aXztbUUeQ/viewform)

Where to get information about data science & machine learning
- Reddit - data is beautiful, Machine Learning, Data Science, Reinforcement Learning
- Medium - [Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/)
- Hacker News
- textbooks - Deep Learning, Pattern Recognition (Bishop), Statistical Learning (Hastie)

Course outline - go through the calendar

Stack of a data scientist

Types of data
- tabular, text, images, time series

Introductions

## Projects

What makes a good project?
1. learning
2. fun / enjoyment
3. showing potential employers

Teams
- better quality projects
- better social experience
- employers value teamwork
- easier for DSR to support less projects
- more time to present on demo day
- more resource to create content like blog posts

How to choose a project?
1. start with dataset - find a problem
2. start with a problem - find a dataset
3. start with an environment - do control
4. start with a paper - reimplement
5. start with a paper - improve
6. build a tool
7. build a dataset
8. kaggle competition

## Food for thought

What are data science, machine learning and AI?
- [decade of deep learning](https://leogao.dev/2019/12/31/The-Decade-of-Deep-Learning/)

Why is TensorFlow free?

## Get to know each other through CV review

[creddle](http://creddle.io/) is useful for creating CVs

## Writing blog posts

[My blog](https://adgefficiency.com/)

> If you write about your passion, you will never lose enthusiasm because you are creating a little corner of the internet that’s yours, you made it, you made it beautiful, and now it’s also available for everyone else, but even if no one shows up, it stands on its own.

> Your career progress is more about how you present your work, than the work itself

Blog = asynchronous, more technical detail, can be updated are re-editied
- technical blog post (cross entropy etc)
- blog post on the project
- my popular posts are beginner ones - this is also easiest for you to write
- tell the story of what you did wrong ([Journey from academic paper to industry usage - Merantix](https://medium.com/merantix/journey-from-academic-paper-to-industry-usage-cf57fe598f31))

[Computers](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/computers.md)

[Tools](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/tree/master/misc/tools.ipynb)

Get setup on conda, setup two virtual environments (one called DSR, one called general)
