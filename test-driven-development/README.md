## Testing & Test Driven Development (TDD)

1. [short lecture on testing & TDD](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/tree/master/testing/README.md),
2. [introduction & practical work on TDD with Python](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/test-driven-development/tdd.ipynb),
3. [a quick look at Hypothesis](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/test-driven-development/hypothesis.ipynb) - a parameterized testing framework.

See also my [notes on Python testing tools](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/test-driven-development/python-testing-tools.md) 


4. we will then break free of the notebook (hooray!) and build a Python package from scratch - see [developing a Python package here](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/test-driven-development/python-packaging.md) and 

- simple test train split
- stratified test train split
- K cross validation folds
- balanced test train split
