## Test driven development & Python packaging

1. [short lecture on test driven development](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/tree/master/test-driven-development)
2. [introduction & practical work on test driven development with Python](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/test-driven-development/tdd.ipynb)
3. [introduction & practical work on sklearn pipelines](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/test-driven-development/sklearn-pipelines.ipynb)
4. [a short look at Hypothesis](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/test-driven-development/hypothesis.ipynb)
5. we will then break free of the notebook (hooray!) and build a Python package from scratch - see [developing a Python package here](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/test-driven-development/python-packaging.md) and [notes on Python testing tools](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/test-driven-development/python-testing-tools.md) will be useful.

- simple test train split
- stratified test train split
- K cross validation folds
- balanced test train split
- visualizations
