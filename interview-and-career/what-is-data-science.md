A list of questions and answers for data science, AI and machine learning.

# Data science

## What is it?

Using quantitative methods to extract business insights from structured & unstructured data

Using structured & unstructured data to make predictions that drive business decisions

Solve optimization problems 

Provide recommendations - prediction

Provide business intelligence - data communication

Drive product decisions

## Business, analytics, engineering

[DSR curriculum](https://datascienceretreat.com/curriculum/) is built into these three.

- how to structure a team
- should I work at this company
- how shoupd I spend my time

Eng = code & compute

## Data analyst versus data scientist versus data engineer

Amount of data

Analyst
- analyzes the past
- GUI tools
- spreadsheet monkey
- VBA, R, SQL
- Power BI, Tableau

Scientist
- predicts the future
- Python, bash, git

Both should influence business decisions (otherwise what is the point?)

Engineer
- Scala & Spark (maybe PySpark)
- databases
- monitoring
- streaming

## What are the key skills of a data scientist?

Statistics & linear algebra

Supervised machine learning
- linear, ensemble methods (forests & boosting), neural nets

Cleaning data
- learn to enjoy this

Optimization
- linear (constrained optimization, MILP etc)
- non-linear (stochastic gradient descent)

Programming
- test driven development

Communication
- writing & speaking
- visualization

Ability to learn
- metaskill

# AI

## What is AI?

Intelligence demonstrated by machines

A contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans

Intelligence 
- learning, problem solving
- competence versus comprehension
- prediction & explainability

## What is the AI effect?

> AI is whatever hasn't been done yet

As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI

## Three types of AI

Analytical
- generating a cognitive representation of the world and using learning based on past experience to inform future decisions

Human inspired
- emotional intelligence
- human decision making

Humanized
- self-conscious and self-aware

## Two approaches

## AI approaches

Statistical
- hidden Markov models
- infomation theory
- Bayesian decision theory

Computational intelligence
- connectionism
- neural networks
- fuzzy systems
- evolutionary methods

Symbolic
- simulating human thought
- formal logic
- hand built
- knowledge based

## AI tools

Search & optimization

Logic

Probabilistic methods

Classifiers & statistical learning methods

Neural networks

## What are we missing to get to “real” AI (LeCun 2019)

We can have
- safer cars 
- autonomous cars
- better medical image analysis
- personalized medicine
- adequate language translation 
- useful but stupid chatbots 
- information search, retrieval, filtering
- numerous applications in energy, finance, manufacturing, environmental protection, commerce, law, artistic creation, games,.....

What we cannot have (yet)
- machines with common sense 
- intelligent personal assistants 
- “smart” chatbots”
- household robots
- agile and dexterous robots
- artificial general intelligence (AGI)

# Machine learning

## What is machine learning?

## Supervised

Training a machine by showing example instead of programming it
- when the output is wrong, tweak the parameters

Examples
- speech to words
- image to classes
- portrait to name
- photo to caption
- text to topic

## What are the three types of machine learning?

Why is ML working today?

- we are the product
- branding
- compute
