## Interview advice

Know how to introduce yourself.  Memorize the first few sentences of your introduction.  One option is to talk about your education and experience:

>  My name is *Adam*.  I have a *Masters in Energy Engineering* from the *University of Manchester*.  I have worked for *4 years* at *ENGIE UK* as an *Energy Engineer*.

Having something memorized means you will always be off to a good start.

## [How to Build a Data Science Portfolio](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-data-science-portfolio-5f566517c79c)

I find that the best portfolio projects are less about doing fancy modeling and more about working with interesting data. A lot of people do things with financial information or Twitter data; those can work, but the data isn’t inherently that interesting, so you’re working uphill.

One of his other points in the article is that webscraping is a great way to get interesting data

When in doubt, here are some projects that hurt you more than they help you:
* Survival classification on the Titanic dataset.
* Hand-written digit classification on the MNIST dataset.
* Flower species classification using the iris dataset.

Resume
1. Length: Keep it simple and one page max. This gives you the most impact for a quick skim. Recommends a simple one column resume as it is easy to skim.
2. Objective: Don’t include one. They don’t help you distinguish yourself from other people. They take away space from the more important things (skills, projects, experience etc). Cover letters are extremely optional unless you really personalize it.
3. Coursework: Do list relevant coursework that is applicable for the job description.
4. Skills: Don’t give numerical ratings for your skills. If you want to rate yourself on your skills, use words like proficient or familiar or things like that. You can even exclude assessments altogether.
5. Skills: Do list technical skills that the job description mentions. The order you list your skills in can suggest what you are best at.
6. Projects: Don’t list common projects or homework. They aren’t that helpful in distinguishing you from other applicants. List projects that are novel.
7. Projects: Show results and include links. If you participated in Kaggle competition, put percentile rank as it helps the person reading your resume understand where you are in the competition. In projects sections, there is always room for links to writeups and papers as they let the hiring manager or recruiter dig in deeper (bias to real world messy problems where you learn something new).

Unlike a resume, which is confined by length, a LinkedIn profile allows you to describe your projects and work experience in more depth. Udacity has a guide on making a good LinkedIn profile. An important part of LinkedIn is their search tool and for you to show up, you must have relevant keywords in your profile. Recruiters often search for people on LinkedIn. LinkedIn allows you to see which companies have searched for you and who has viewed your profile.
