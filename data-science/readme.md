# Data Science

![](assets/karpathy.png)

- research = worry about models
- actual applications = worry about data
- this course is about the data

If you are looking for data to practice your skill so, [check out this list of datasets here](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/programming-resources/blob/master/data-science/datasets.md).
