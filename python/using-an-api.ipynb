    "- structured\n",
    "- provided as a service (you are talking to a server via a REST API)\n",

    "- API developer can not maintain the API\n",
    "- website page can change HTML structure\n",
    "- website page can have dynamic (Javascript) content that requires execution (usually done by the browser) before the correct HTML is available\n",
