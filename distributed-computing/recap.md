Functional programming
- no side effects, functions first class, variables that don't vary
- same list comprehensions
- map, filter, reduce, lambda

Computers
- CPU = hardware, one thing at a time
- IO bound, CPU bound

Threads vs processes
- memory sharing

Concurrency = program structure

Paralleism = execution
- special case of concurrency

IO = do something else while you wait

CPU = parallel

Memory = batches

Distrubted = many machines

---

MapReduce
- mapping to (key, value) pairs
- collection
- reduce

Distrubted computation in Python
- Spark - widely used, JVM, pyspark
- dask = distributing pandas
- ray = more general purpose, actor (state), hyperparameter tuning

asynio
- modern solution for IO bound problems
