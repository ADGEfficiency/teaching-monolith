# Python Packing with Pip & `setup.py`

We will break free of the notebook (hooray!) and build a Python package from scratch - see [developing a Python package here](https://github.com/ADGEfficiency/teaching-monolith/blob/master/test-driven-development/python-packaging.md) and 

- simple test train split,
- stratified test train split
- K cross validation folds
- balanced test train split
