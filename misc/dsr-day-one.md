- bathroom - shut the main door
- dishwasher - use it!  don't put your dishes in the sink!

## Writing blog posts

Your career progress is more about how you present your work, than the work itself

Blog = asynchronous, more technical detail, can be updated are re-editied

Expectation of students is
- one technical blog post (cross entropy etc)
- blog post on the project
- my popular posts are beginner ones - this is also easiest for you to write
- tell the story of what you did wrong
